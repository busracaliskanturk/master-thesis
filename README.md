# Project Name: Topic Modeling using LDA, NMF and BERTopic on ChatGPT related Twitter data

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform topic modeling using LDA, NMF and BERTopic algorithms on a Twitter dataset. It preprocesses the data, applies different topic modeling algorithms, and visualizes the results to identify the dominant topics within the tweets.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3
- Required Python packages (install using `pip`): `bertopic`, `nltk`, `spacy`, `hdbscan`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `wordcloud`, `gensim`, `pyLDAvis`, `seaborn`, `umap-learn`

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages using the following command:

3. Download the 'en_core_web_sm' model for spaCy using the following command:

4. Load your Twitter dataset by modifying the `df` variable in the code.

5. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform topic modeling with LDA, NMF and BERTopic.

## Project Structure

- `BERTopic.py`: The Python script that contains the code for topic modeling using BERTopic.
- `LDA.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook  that contains the code for data exploring data preprocessing and  topic modeling using LDA 
- `NMF.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook  that contains the code for topic modeling using NMF.
- `visualization.html`: HTML file containing the interactive visualization of topics generated by LDA.
- `topic_hierarchy.html`: HTML file containing the interactive visualization of the topic hierarchy generated by BERTopic.
- `README.md`: This README file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for running it.

## Usage

- Run the code in the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts to preprocess the data, perform topic modeling, and visualize the results.
- For LDA and NMF models, it is suggested to run the provided Jupyter Notebooks. However, for BERTopic, running it in Jupyter Notebook may lead to memory issues. Hence, it is recommended to use IntelliJ or other suitable IDE for running BERTopic.

## Visualization

- To view the interactive visualization of topics generated by LDA using pyLDAvis, click [here](https://busracaliskanturk.github.io/pyLDAvis_visualization/).

- To explore the inter-topic distance map generated by BERTopic, click [here](https://busracaliskanturk.github.io/BERTopic_visualization/).


## Results

- The BERTopic model will generate topics and probabilities for each tweet.
- The LDA and NMF model will display the top words for each topic, along with their corresponding weights.
